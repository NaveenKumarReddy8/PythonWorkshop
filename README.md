To generate the markdown file of a particular .ipynb notebook:

```Shell

# Single file
jupyter nbconvert --to markdown <ipynb file>

# Multiple files

for f in *.ipynb; do jupyter nbconvert --to markdown $f; done
```


To concat multiple markdown files we use pandoc

```Shell
pandoc -s 1_file.md 2_file.md 3_file.md -o merge.md

# We do use chronological numerical order in our repo, so we can write the above command as:
pandoc -s $(ls -v *.md) -o merge.md
```

To convert the pandoc style markdown file generated to Github Flavoured markdown:

```Shell
pandoc -s merge.md -o github_flavoured_markdown.md --to gfm
```
